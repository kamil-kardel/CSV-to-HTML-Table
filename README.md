# CSV-to-HTML-Table
a Windows PowerShell script that converts a CSV file to a basic HTML table, with a simple GUI window

The script has been inspired by my friend Lorenzo. In his quest to learn Polish, he has decided to run a blog and have its readers submit corrections.

It may be useful, if you need a quick HTML table for a blog post and you are a Windows user.
The script shows a simple window that lets you:
<ul>
  <li>open a file,</li>
  <li>choose delimiter and character encoding,</li>
  <li>preview the content (to see the options are correct for the input file),</li>
  <li>save the file in the preferred location,</li>
  <li>set up default delimiter and encoding.</li>
</ul>

The functionalities also include error message popups.
